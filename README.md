Hello. These are some of the projects I have been doing.

The CO2 Emission by Vehicle project was designed to deepen knowledge from chapter 2 of the book Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow by author Aurélien Géron.

The Titanic project aimed to participate in a Kaggle competition.

The Regression and Blood project is not yet finished
